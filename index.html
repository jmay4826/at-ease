                  Stephen lives in Warner Robins, Georgia where he has done so
                  since 1998. He retired from the U.S. Air Force in 2005 as a
                  Master Sergeant specializing in communications. He spent the
                  next seven years as a defense contractor continuing to serve
                  our nation's military in the fields of video teleconferencing
                  and logistics. In the spring of 2012 while still a defense
                  contractor, he began the journey to become a licensed massage
                  therapist pursuing a passion long overdue. Then, unexpectedly
                  in early 2013, he left defense contracting all together and
                  decided to focus solely on his massage therapy studies. By
                  October of 2013, he was licensed and practicing in the state
                  of Georgia.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In January of 2014, he accepted a position with Global Body
                  Works where he practiced both chair and table massage therapy
                  at the Children's hospitals in Atlanta working on the doctors,
                  nurses, and parents of the child patients. In June of 2014, he
                  transitioned to lead therapist at Eagles Landing Wellness and
                  Chiropractic Center working in concert with the excellent
                  chiropractic and wellness staff there. Then, in June of 2016,
                  he accepted a position at 'At Ease' and remains there to this
                  day. He is very skilled at deep tissue, neuromuscular therapy
                  (NMT) and seated massage. He considers those to be his
                  strongest modalities despite holding certifications in others
                  as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Stephen was born in Columbus, Ohio, raised in Southbridge,
                  Massachusetts and attended Ohio State University for several
                  years before entering the military. During his 22 year
                  military career that began in 1984, he lived in the United
                  Kingdom, Japan, Germany and several other U.S. locations. He
                  also served multiple tours in the Middle East during the wars
                  in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is married to his wife Carole who
                  hails from the United Kingdom and together they have two grown
                  children, Nicole and Bryan. They also have three grandsons,
                  Christian, Mason, and Chase. He enjoys playing golf, water
                  color, and spending time with his family, who by-the-way, are
                  all die-hard New England Patriots fans since the early 1970's.

                  Her journey with disordered eating eventually brought her to a
                  weight of 250lbs. She was finally over it and her journey to
                  overcome a lifelong battle began in earnest. She began working
                  to lose the weight, which eventually totaled a loss of 105lbs.
                  Tammy has worked as a group fitness instructor and personal
                  trainer since that time.. She returned to school and completed
                  her bachelor's degree in Health and Wellness.

                  God’s plan continued to unfold in 2018 as she began her
                  journey to become a yoga teacher and massage therapist. She
                  completed her 200hr yoga certification in December and
                  graduated from massage therapy school in March. She feels her
                  greatest call is to be of service to others through modalities
                  that offer healing and rejuvenation of the mind, body, and
                  spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tammy has been married for 21 years and is a mom of 5. She has
                  run 2 half marathons and competed twice as a figure

                  Currently she is working to resolve dysfunctional muscular adaptations. She'll soon present her field of study entitled Muscular Movement Massage.

                  Niko has instructed just about every foundational massage subject available. This proficiency affords her the opportunity to work with professional athletes. Recently, coming off of a "Wubble" season with CT Sun, they made it all the way to the Final Four against the elitist of athletes and are geared to go all the way this year.

                  While Niko is creating change throughout this phenomenal industry, she increasingly enjoys revelational love with her betrothed, Charmaine Y Clark, her magnanimous son Donté and her cheerfully resilient nephew Ashton.

                Ron, Debbie's husband, joined the At Ease family in 2002 and
                continued to bring the healing effects of therapeutic massage to
                his clients until his passing in 2017. Ron brought an
                unforgettable energy and culture to At Ease and will always be
                affectionately remembered as Dr. Pain.
