                I am truly excited to be a team member at At Ease Therapeutic Massage, Inc. This opportunity allows me to return home to
                Warner Robins and showcase my massage therapy abilities alongside the other excellent therapists. It is my
                goal to see that the needs of every client are met with quality care and professionalism at all times."
              </p>
              <div id="stephen-full" class="profile-full">
                <p>Stephen lives in Warner Robins, Georgia where he has done so since 1998. He retired from the U.S. Air Force
                  in 2005 as a Master Sergeant specializing in communications. He spent the next seven years as a defense
                  contractor continuing to serve our nation's military in the fields of video teleconferencing and logistics.
                  In the spring of 2012 while still a defense contractor, he began the journey to become a licensed massage
                  therapist pursuing a passion long overdue. Then, unexpectedly in early 2013, he left defense contracting
                  all together and decided to focus solely on his massage therapy studies. By October of 2013, he was licensed
                  and practicing in the state of Georgia.</p>

                <p>In January of 2014, he accepted a position with Global Body Works where he practiced both chair and table
                  massage therapy at the Children's hospitals in Atlanta working on the doctors, nurses, and parents of the
                  child patients. In June of 2014, he transitioned to lead therapist at Eagles Landing Wellness and Chiropractic
                  Center working in concert with the excellent chiropractic and wellness staff there. Then, in June of 2016,
                  he accepted a position at 'At Ease' and remains there to this day. He is very skilled at deep tissue, neuromuscular
                  therapy (NMT) and seated massage. He considers those to be his strongest modalities despite holding certifications
                  in others as well.</p>

                <p>Stephen was born in Columbus, Ohio, raised in Southbridge, Massachusetts and attended Ohio State University
                  for several years before entering the military. During his 22 year military career that began in 1984,
                  he lived in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and several other U.S. locations. He also served multiple
                  tours in the Middle East during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is married to his wife Carole who
                  hails from the United Kingdom and together they have two grown children, Nicole and Bryan. They also have
                  three grandsons, Christian, Mason, and Chase. He enjoys playing golf, water color, and spending time with
                  his family, who by-the-way, are all die-hard New England Patriots fans since the early 1970's. Go Patriots!</p>
